# Batocera  Megadrive restyle 

Currently EmulationStation used in Batocera is aimed to be "Xbox" or "Switch" or "Playstation" gamepad 'oriented'. 

But if you fan of Genesis/Megadrive consoles - your main gamepad can be Sega-inspired 6-buttons 'ABC/xyz' controllers like amazing 8bitDO M30 or Retroflag.

Thus confuse seriously on helpbar how to navigate alongside EmulationStation.

- Unfortunatelly not only Emulation station require update. Libretro also use some images assets to visualise buttons in menu (Batocera uses XMB menu provider). This assets are located at ```/usr/share/libretro/assets/xmb/monochrome/png``` and will be overwritten by package.
